# CloudGenie (just say it — your app appears)

An AI-driven Internal Developer Platform (IDP) that streamlines infrastructure provisioning, application deployment, and environment management using Crossplane and ArgoCD, with a developer-friendly UI & chat assistant.
The platform empowers developers to focus on coding while the AI assistant and GitOps workflows handle infrastructure, CI/CD, and environment lifecycles automatically.

## Problem Statement

Developers often struggle with:

1. Understanding infrastructure setup and deployment pipelines.
2. Context switching between CLI tools, YAML manifests, and cloud consoles.
3. Slow onboarding and inconsistent environment provisioning.
4. Difficulty diagnosing deployment or configuration issues

## AI Use Cases

1. AI-Powered Environment Setup: Developers describe their app, and AI scaffolds everything (Dockerfile, K8s manifests, Crossplane configs).

2. AI Observability Assistant: When deployments fail, AI inspects logs and metrics, suggests reasons (e.g., “Container CrashLoop — missing DB credentials.”).

3. AI Recommendation Engine: Suggests optimal infrastructure (e.g., “Use RDS with 2 vCPUs for your traffic pattern.”)

4. Continuous Learning: AI models improve recommendations based on previous successful deployments.

## System Architecture

TBD
